<h1 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h1>
<p>
  Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and
  intuition.
</p>
<h2 id="wisdom-checks">Wisdom Checks</h2>
<p>
  A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings,
  notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight,
  Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you can calm down a
  domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM
  might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to
  control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true
  intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move.
  Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion
  or diagnose an illness.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise
  detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the
  keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door,
  eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try
  to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road,
  thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Survival.</strong> The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow
  tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears
  live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to
  accomplish tasks like the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
  <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h2>
<p>
  Clerics, Druids, and Rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the
  saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
